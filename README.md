=================

Where I put all my stuff. This is a website dedicated to showcasing some of my work that I do in my spare time.

* `/apps/` contains interactive applications written both for the Web and for desktop. These are more worked on 
and rigorously tested.
* `/games/` contains, you guessed it, games. Mostly quick JavaScript things that I thought of doing, but I might 
consider completing some real games in an engine of some sort.
* `/projects/` will contain major works that are too large for a single URL. They are ambitious and take up a lot 
of time. I hope to make some more of these in the future.
* `/proto/` is where the concepts for applications are born - they are simple, rudimentary and put together with a
single goal in mind; will it work?

This website uses a custom-built content management system that uses JSON to store all sorts of data about all this
work and display them in a thumbnail gallery format. I might consider upgrading it to be a little bit more user-friendly,
but it works well for now.
