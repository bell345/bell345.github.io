=================

This is the website and platform that I will be uploading my work and prototype code for all of the world to see. Not much else to say about it, really.

If you are here to copy/edit my code; /assets/js/tbi.js is the site-wide code used by everything, and /assets/js/proto.js is the code for the prototypes.
