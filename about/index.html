        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2 id="me">Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I'm Thomas Bell, currently a first-year undergraduate at Curtin University. I'm studying Electronic and
            Communication Engineering and Computer Science as a double degree (I love saying that one out loud). My
            interests include technology, mathematics, computer graphics, design, and learning Japanese as a second language.
        </p><p>
            Programming has held a special place in my heart ever since my high school's Specialist ICT program introduced
            me to the versatility and boundless potential of websites and web programming. My favourite languages include
            Python, JavaScript (both on the front end and the back end), C++, ANSI C and C#. Many of my personal projects
            are open-source - I believe development is better when it's more collaborative and free to view, allowing
            code to thrive and expand much more quickly and effectively.
        </p>
        <h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            I like privacy, and so do you. I try and make everything I create free, open and collect as little information as possible. However,
            I am now using Google Analytics on my website, mainly because I want to find out more about people who visit this place and where they
            come from. And like any good privacy-concerned service, I have provided an opt-out for those who object to even simple analytics.
            <strong>I do not, and will never, serve ads on this website or use your information for profit.</strong>
        </p><p>
            <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs/#what_data_does_the_tracking_snippet_capture">
                Here is a list of basic information that Google Analytics collects.
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><a href="/about/optout">Click here to opt out of Google Analytics tracking.</a></strong>
        </p>
        <h2 id="website">This Website</h2>
        <p>
            It started out as a side project after I had finished working on a website assignment for school. I would make quick little applications
            and put it on this website on a local web server. It only got off the ground and into the cloud once I moved to GitHub Pages. It's still
            nothing that remarkable, but I'd like to think that one day it'll be one of those things you can look back on when I'm all grown up.
        </p>
        <h2 id="contact">Contacting Me</h2>
        <p>
            Want to talk? I am very reserved, so I don't go on social media websites that often. Your best bet at having a conversation is to
            <a href="mailto:tom.aus@outlook.com">email me</a>. I do have Facebook, Twitter, Skype, all that, but I'd rather not share
            to people whom I don't necessarily know anything about. My <a href="http://github.com/bell345">GitHub profile</a> has a few
            more projects that I might not have uploaded to this website yet. I should get into the habit of making more commits.
        </p>
        <h2 id="license">Content Licensing</h2>
        <p>
            Legal stuff is a pain, so I release all my <em>coding</em> work under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>.
            What that means is that you can copy, edit, redistribute, remix and even commercially sell things based upon my work under one condition:
            <strong>You must attribute me in the product.</strong> My name and a link back to the website should suffice as attribution.
            The words, creative works and styling that I have produced are covered under the
            <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0">CC BY</a> license. You can do the same as the MIT License, under the same conditions
            as well; it's a little more formal. Any concerns can be redirected to <a href="mailto:tom.aus@outlook.com">my email</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Other People's Work</h3>
        <p>
            The above does not apply to stuff that other people have made, but I am using in the website. Here is a short rundown of things that I haven't made:
        </p>
        <ul class="txt">
            <li>
                The icons for the navigation to the left and right, excluding the "V6" logo down the lower right, are courtesy of
                <a href="http://iconmonstr.com">iconmonstr.com</a>. It's a pretty cool free icon website that lets you use as many
                icons as you want without attribution. There are still <em>some</em> <a href="http://iconmonstr.com/license">terms and conditions</a> you
                have to follow, however.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a> is an excellent JavaScript library that handles a lot of things, and which I use liberally. It belongs to the
                <a href="https://jquery.org">jQuery Foundation</a>, and is licensed under the <a href="https://jquery.org/license">MIT License</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any other people's code which I use will be pointed at by documentation and in the descriptions for the projects themselves.
            </li>
        </ul>
