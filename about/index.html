        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2 id="me">Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a fifteen year old high school student who likes to program and make websites in my spare time. I am highly interested
            in computer science and technology. I am very keen to learn about technological subjects and to expand my knowledge. When I'm
            not programming, I'm on <a href="http://reddit.com/u/isurvived12">Reddit</a> and playing games on
            <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/bell345">Steam</a>. Personally, I am greatly excited about the future of computer science
            and technology &mdash; it's a better time than ever to get into the industry!
        </p><p>
            I own two computers, one I built myself (i3-4160 and GTX 750 Ti if anyone's asking) and one for school. I'm a big Linux nut, and
            I pray for the day that it finally becomes accepted enough that I'll be able to play all my games on it, no problems. I like listening
            to Spotify, especially alternative rock and electronic music. Say what you will about my music tastes. I'm adaptable with programming
            languages, but I'm most comfortable with JavaScript, C++ and the like.
        </p>
        <h2 id="website">This Website</h2>
        <p>
            It started out as a side project after I had finished working on a website assignment for school. I would make quick little applications
            and put it on this website on a local web server. It only got off the ground and into the cloud once I moved to GitHub Pages. It's still
            nothing that remarkable, but I'd like to think that one day it'll be one of those things you can look back on when I'm all grown up.
        </p>
        <h2 id="contact">Contacting Me</h2>
        <p>
            Want to talk? I am very reserved, so I don't go on social media websites that often. Your best bet at having a conversation is to
            <a href="mailto:tom.aus@outlook.com">email me</a>. I do have Facebook, Twitter, Skype, all that, but I'd rather not share
            to people whom I don't necessarily know anything about. My <a href="http://github.com/bell345">GitHub profile</a> has a few
            more projects that I might not have uploaded to this website yet (probably because they're unremarkable). I should get into
            the habit of making more commits.
        </p>
        <h2 id="license">Content Licensing</h2>
        <p>
            Legal stuff is a pain, so I release all my <em>coding</em> work under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT License</a>.
            What that means is that you can copy, edit, redistribute, remix and even commercially sell things based upon my work under one condition:
            <strong>You must attribute me in the product.</strong> My name and a link back to the website should suffice as attribution.
            The words, creative works and styling that I have produced are covered under the
            <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0">CC BY</a> license. You can do the same as the MIT License, under the same conditions
            as well; it's a little more formal. Any concerns can be redirected to <a href="mailto:tom.aus@outlook.com">my email</a>.
        </p>
        <h3>Other People's Work</h3>
        <p>
            The above does not apply to stuff that other people have made, but I am using in the website. Here is a short rundown of things that I haven't made:
        </p>
        <ul class="txt">
            <li>
                The icons for the navigation to the left and right, excluding the "V6" logo down the lower right, are courtesy of
                <a href="http://iconmonstr.com">iconmonstr.com</a>. It's a pretty cool free icon website that lets you use as many
                icons as you want without attribution. There are still <em>some</em> <a href="http://iconmonstr.com/license">terms and conditions</a> you
                have to follow, however.
            </li>
            <li>
                <a href="https://jquery.com">jQuery</a> is an excellent JavaScript library that handles a lot of things, and which I use liberally. It belongs to the
                <a href="https://jquery.org">jQuery Foundation</a>, and is licensed under the <a href="https://jquery.org/license">MIT License</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                Any other people's code which I use will be pointed at by documentation and in the descriptions for the projects themselves.
            </li>
        </ul>
