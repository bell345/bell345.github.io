            <h2>Who I Am</h2>
            <p>
                I am a thirteen year old hobbyist web developer / high school student highly interested in
                computer science and information technology. Most of the time, when I'm not at school, I 
                browse the Internet and develop websites and web applications. I don't believe in using 
                templates or "cheating" to get ahead - when I do something, I tend to do it from scratch. I 
                fuss over projects, making sure they not only meet their standards, but mine as well. I am 
                very excited for the future of both myself and technology in general.
            </p>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>
                Since I am generally not very outgoing, it may be a little difficult for you to contact me. I'll most likely 
                get back to you if you <a href="mailto:tom.aus@outlook.com" class="email-link">email</a> me,
                however.
            </p>
