    This is a simple Windows application that helps to change the logon background in
    Windows Vista/7. Tested to work on Windows 7 64-bit, and it does require administrator
    access (as it modifies the registry).

    This might be labelled internally as "LogonBGChanger2" - for a good reason - I had to
    make the program <em>again from scratch</em> because I lost the source while configuring
    Git with Visual Studio. They do not play nice.
