    A quick and dirty JavaScript calculator that works very similarly to conventional scientific calculators.
    It can perform basic arithmetic, as well as trigonometric and exponential functions. Input can be done
    through the use of the mouse and the virtual keypad interface, as well as through keyboard shortcuts.

    It isn't very well constructed, and I've left it alone in favour of more exciting projects. It probably
    has bugs galore, as it hasn't been thoroughly tested.
