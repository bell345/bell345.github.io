    <s>Since this is the first project of mine that actually needs a dynamic web server and private
    credentials, I've hosted it on an AWS Free Tier EC2 instance with the IP address
    <code>52.64.90.134</code>. </s>I'm now no longer eligible for the AWS Free Tier, and as such I
    am forced to close my EC2 instance, lest I get billed (<em>gasp</em>). The source code is still
    up, so I imagine someone might want to put it up on their server instead, and by all means go ahead.

    It's a small node.js server I made to solve a problem with Spotify's shuffle feature, in
    that it only shuffles 50 or so songs and then resamples, with repeats! This app creates a truly
    random playlist enjoyed without shuffle for your listening pleasure from one of your public,
    private or followed playlists (note: it doesn't modify the original).
