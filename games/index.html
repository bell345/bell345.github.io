            <h1>Games</h1>
            <p>
                As you can see, I've been playing with web apps made with JavaScript, learning things along
                the way. Nothing wrong with that - it's just the way I code. But recently I have been
                running out of ideas for web apps. They've all been done! So I decided to experiment with
                games - specifically the programming of them. At the moment, my eyes are focused upon
                Java and various engines (Java3D) and Unity, both of which I enjoy immensely.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lots of this stuff is not only unfinished, but never going to be finished. Again, if I do
                complete any of this, it'll go on the <a href="/apps">applications</a> page.

                    This is an basic simulation game in which you are a kid with a big imagination
                    and builds a treehouse near his house. Raising money through a lemonade stand, you
                    have to upgrade your treehouse and make it into a world-famous attraction!
                    At the moment, I have no art assets, or much experience to make good ones. Help would
                    be appreciated.

                    Using the free version of <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/download">Unity Editor</a>, I
                    followed a basic tutorial to make a top-down space shoot-em-up, to get a feel for Unity and
                    how it works.

                    About the game: WASD to move, Left-Click to fire, and R to restart once you explode.
                    Simple and fun (to make, at least). I must note that this is at <em>least</em> 20 times
                    better looking, more workable and more fun to play with than my most advanced
                    <a href="http://yoyogames.com/studio/download">Game Maker</a> game. Bear in mind - I <em>
                        had the
