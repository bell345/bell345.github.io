    This is an basic simulation game in which you are a kid with a big imagination
    and builds a treehouse near his house. Raising money through a lemonade stand, you
    have to upgrade your treehouse and make it into a world-famous attraction!
    At the moment, I have no art assets, or much experience to make good ones. Help would
    be appreciated.

    At the moment, it is almost completely empty and currently on hiatus, but I might
    continue working on it and over-hauling it to be a web-based progressive game.
    Only time will tell.
