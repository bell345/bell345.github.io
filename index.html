        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
            You seem to have stumbled upon my website.
        </p><p>
            I am a newly minted adult who loves technology, especially software. This website hasn't seen a lot of
            activity lately, but I am still searching for projects that are intriguing and rewarding. To get an idea of
            what this website is about, see the <a href="apps">apps page</a>, which contains lots of interesting web
            projects I worked on when I was in high school.
        </p><p>
            I'm hoping to be involved in more large-scale work, so I set up the <a href="projects">projects page</a>
            for when that does happen. Right now, it contains a multi-user quiz app that I created for my friends to use.
        </p><p>
            Python has always been a special interest of mine - check out my
            <a href="https://github.com/bell345">GitHub</a> page to see my Python work, which includes a command-line
            TV guide, a pseudo-code interpreter and a very special program for translating
            <a href="http://xkcd.com/1678/">GIFs into XLS files</a>.
