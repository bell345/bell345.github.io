            <p>
                You seem to have stumbled upon my website.
            </p><p>
                Quick introduction: I am a 14 year old high school student who likes coding,
                especially in JavaScript. I don't go out much and I tend to obsess over computers.
            </p><p>
                Aside from looking at the background for too long, you can have a
                peek at my <a href="/proto/">prototypes</a> page and look at interactive applications
                that haven't all been completed yet.
            </p><p>
                If I ever complete anything, they'll moved to the <a href="/apps/">applications</a> page.
            </p>
            <h3 class="item para"><a href="#"> > Links</a></h3>
            <p>
                Many of the items on my website will have a link attached to their titles, where you get to see
                either the actual thing or a standalone version, etc. These are marked with a blue "&gt;" just before
                the title (kinda like the example above), and clicking on them will take you to another page either
                on this website or another one. You can also click the <i class="fa fa-external-link-square"></i>
                boxes in the nav bar up the top.
            </p>
