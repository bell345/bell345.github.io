        <p>
            You seem to have stumbled upon my website.
        </p><p>
            Quick introduction: I am a 15 year old high school student who likes coding,
            especially in JavaScript. I don't go out much and I tend to obsess over computers.
        </p><p>
            To have a look at what I do in my free time, check out the <a href="apps">Applications</a>
            page, full of interactive stuff that I put some effort into. If you are more of a "live life
            on the edge" type of person, have a look at the <a href="proto">Prototypes</a> page for
            unfinished, but potentially exciting, technical things.
