    After watching a few introductory videos on complex numbers and how they could generate
    fractals, I decided to implement a few complex number functions in JavaScript. This is
    the result.
</p>
<p>
    To generate a fractal (in this case, the Mandelbrot set), simply click on the blue "Generate"
    button at the bottom of the area. If you want to see more of the fractal, simply
    bump up the "Maximum Iterations" value. After a point (specifically >600) it starts to become
    ludicrously slow to generate, so I've stopped it there.
</p>
<p>
    Speaking of speed, you can decrease the quality by clicking on one of the "Quality" buttons.
    This will help with speed problems once you start exploring the fractal further.
</p>
<p>
    You can center the view anywhere on the screen. Simply click on your new center in the fractal
    area. To zoom in, increase the "Zoom Factor" by around 1. You can also view the path that the
    complex numbers take by toggling the "Line tracking" feature.
</p>
<p>
    "Switch Mode" allows you to toggle between Mandelbrot and Julia sets. With Julia sets, you can
    adjust the real and imaginary components to get different fractals. "Reset Settings" does
    what you think it does.
</p>
<p>
    Don't forget, to see your changes in action, click the "Generate" button. However, clicking on
    the fractal to set the pan values is immediate, so you might have to wait a bit for the
    fractal to generate.
