    Isn't emulation fun? Here is my very first emulator: one for the ancient Intel 8080 microprocessor! Based primarily
    off of the work of
    <a href="http://typedarray.org/intel-8080-cpu-emulation-in-javascript">Thibault Imbert</a>, this learning exercise
    was extremely interesting and taught me a lot about old school processors and architectures of the time. I
    definitely enjoyed it, and I hope you will enjoy the "Space Invaders" ROM pre-loaded on it!

    Also includes, <em>free of charge</em>, a debugger and disassembler! Just stop the emulation
    by clicking the "Stop" button and use the "Step" button to step through each instruction
    individually. You can also directly modify the registers and CPU pointers using the boxes to
    the right of the display.
