    <strong>Strike</strong> is a maths game where you pick 3 random numbers,
    typically from 1-10, and use arithmetic operations such as addition,
    subtraction, exponentation and the factorial function to try and manipulate
    the three numbers to arrive at all of the numbers from 1 through 10.
</p><p>
    For some combinations, however, it becomes impossible to reach all of the
    numbers 1 through 10 using the numbers only once; and for these, the game
    is considered invalid.
</p><p>
    This tool was designed to both find these impossible combinations, and also
    to use computers to brute-force &mdash; i.e. cheat &mdash; and get all of the
    answers. Using the power of expression trees, this tool can randomly generate
    all of the arithmetic possibilities and return the ones that reach the target numbers.
